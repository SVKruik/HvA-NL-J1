# SK Metrics

> NOTE 2: I have completed the assignment described below and have shutdown the website. I removed all domain records but will keep the code archived.
>
> NOTE 1: for now SK Metrics is used for an university assignment, so no SK Platform metrics at this time. Come back later for the full Houston experience.

> Affiliated with the AUAS? Please ignore everthing related to 'SK Platform', as this is not directly relevant for my internship completion at this time. Besides irrelevance, links and websites might not be operational. For now, only SK Metrics is a high priority uptime project. That being said, feel free to browse and click around of course.

Welcome to SK Metrics, the mission control of SK Platform. It provides users with advanced in-depth real-time data on performance, traffic and much more. This data can be used to generate reports, analyse trends and to see if a third Raspberry is needed.

Because a simple `README.md` can only do so much, I have also made an documentation platform, [SK Docs](https://platform.stefankruik.com/documentation). If you are serious about using my products, I highly recommend reading the relevant articles. Don't have time for that? Don't hesitate to [reach out](https://skpvt.io/r/support). I am always open to have a chat and answer questions to your heart's content, unless I am debugging deployment 😄.
