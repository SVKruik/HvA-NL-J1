# Bot Commander

A cross-platform desktop app build with Tauri to modify the settings of Apricaria, a general-purpose Discord bot. This app is for operators of my Bots that want to alter the settings of Apricaria.

In my configuration of Tauri I use Vue 3 in the frontend, and Rust in the backend.

You can have a look at Apricaria [here](https://github.com/SVKruik-Organization/Discord-Bots).
