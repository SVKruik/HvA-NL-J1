#### Sprint 1

This Sprint we are focusing mainly on the front-end side of things. We want to create a general flow and looks of the project. We want to setup the Vue core (session, routing) and start building the most important views.

Furthermore, Stefan will be setting up CI/CD and the infrastructure (database, SFTP, domain) as these are not supplied by the AUAS (for now).

So in short, setting up the main flow of the app and finalizing our workspace for the upcoming Sprints.

#### Sprint 2

This Sprint we will focus on the front-end while still bring a lot of new functionality. In Sprint 1, we have only built a couple of views, and focused on the infrastructure as a whole. Now that the infrastructuur including deployment and back-end is complete, we can build more views.

@kruiksv also added some new labels: `Depth`. These indicate what part of the application will be built in relation to the User Story. This way we know if only the front-end will be built, only the back-end or full stack.

And finally @schapem3 will make some more designs for others to build.

#### Sprint 3

This Sprint will also be a very functionality-focussed sprint.  Most of the pages are done, but often need further polishing and refining. Some new pages we will ship include the Settings & Post Create page. One other thing that we will expand upon this Sprint, is the mailing system and mailing system. These are not implemented as much as we want them to be, so we will change that this Sprint.

We hope to finish the final pages, so that we can receive the final feedback.

#### Sprint 4

This Sprint we will be finalizing the product. Not a lot will be added, and we will focus on the other parts that will be graded. Some pages or components that were not finished in Sprint 3, will now build.

So besides the product with it's minor additions and fixes, we will write Unit Tests in JUnit and Jest, and work on the technical documentation.
