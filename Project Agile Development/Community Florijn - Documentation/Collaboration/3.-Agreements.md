A list of rules and agreements complementary to the official [Contract](https://gitlab.fdmci.hva.nl/pad/2223/flo/team-8/-/wikis/Collaboration/1.-Contract).

---

#### Meetings Activities

- Goals
- Code/Design Review
- Brainstorming
- Sizing up
- New task divisions
- Plan

#### Rules

- Meetings are mandatory for every member, unless stated otherwise.
- Official documentation about tasks is leading. Word to word agreements have to be re-documented. This is to prevent miscommunication, and a outdated division of tasks.
- Communication goes via the WhatsApp group or Discord server.
- Notify the other members when you start on a task that isn't officially documented.
- You are responsible for your own task. Helping others with their tasks will not make them your responsibility.
- If you are done with your assigned task, inquire with the other members if you help them.
- Check if editing another file will not conflict with other members working on that same file. This is to avoid merge conflicts.
- Decision-making is democratic.
- If you think you won't make a deadline, notify the members timely.
- Check if files that have to be turned in together are ready. This will prevent multiple different versions being turned in, with some versions being older.
- For HEX and RGB colours use CSS [variables](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp) in the `:root`. Contact the note taker to have your new color added to the Wiki [page](https://gitlab.fdmci.hva.nl/pad/2223/flo/team-8/-/wikis/Collaboration/4.-Styling). This makes it easy to change and read colours.
