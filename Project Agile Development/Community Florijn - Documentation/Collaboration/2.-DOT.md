#### Week 2.1

That concludes Sprint 2. Sprint 2 was mostly about expansion and new functions. In Sprint 3 refining is our focus. Some pages need some touchups and polishing. Page refining will be nested within one User Story.

This week we made a new division of tasks. We got together to see what we need to working on this Sprint. As mentioned before, refining is key since most of the features and all the pages are already there.

Furthermore, a member has left the group. He was responsible for the support and settings page. Considering these were of low quality and are using Bootstrap for the styling, Donovan and Stefan will be rewriting these from scratch.

#### Week 2.4

The last Sprint for project PAD has begun. For this Sprint we will further polish and improve our pages. For our new feature that we'll be delivering: User Achievements. This will be a new system for our platform, that engages users of Community Florijn even more. An example of an achievement: Post your first story!

This was an idea pitched by Stefan, to which the others agreed. For now, we will have 5 different achievements spread across the platform. We might increase this number, depending on time and resources.

This system will be implemented where relevant, and Stefan will get the database ready. That's it! Sprint 4: polishing and achievements.
