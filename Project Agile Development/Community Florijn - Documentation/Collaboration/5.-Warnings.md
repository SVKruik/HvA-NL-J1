This is a table where all the official `warnings` are documented. A member can receive a warning by breaking a rule documented in the [Contract](https://gitlab.fdmci.hva.nl/pad/2223/flo/team-8/-/wikis/Collaboration/1.-Contract) and/or [Agreements](https://gitlab.fdmci.hva.nl/pad/2223/flo/team-8/-/wikis/Collaboration/3.-Agreements).

Different violations have different warning increases. This is also documented in the [Contract](https://gitlab.fdmci.hva.nl/pad/2223/flo/team-8/-/wikis/Collaboration/1.-Contract).
