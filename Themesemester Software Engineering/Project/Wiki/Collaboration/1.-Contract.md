#### Meetings

To make sure everyone knows about each other’s whereabouts we organize weekly meetings. The goal of these meetings is to make division of tasks, peer review code and general planning. The duration of this meeting is variable, but we reserve at least one hour. Because of long travel times for on-premises meetings we hold them online in a dedicated Discord server.

Apart from the general meetings we also have an extra meeting before sprint reviews. During this meeting we make and prepare the presentation and demo.

#### Deadlines

The official deadline from the AUAS is on the sprint review itself. Our deadline is the last Sunday before every sprint review to create a safety buffer. This way we can fix and troubleshoot if necessary.

#### Misconduct

For handling misconduct we use a warning system. When a member reaches the warning threshold, we will first schedule a meeting on our own to discuss solutions. If this did not have the desired result, we will contact the teacher.

We have agreed upon a warning threshold of `3` warnings.

| Description | Consequence | Ticket |
|-|-|-|
| Unreported late for meeting upwards of 5 minutes. | 1 warning | WS1 |
| Unreported absence during a meeting. | 2 warnings | WS2 |
| Missing a deadline unannounced. | 3 warnings | WS3 |
| Delivered code does not meet the conventions for the second+ time. | 1 warning | WS4 |
| Absenteeism for meetings was reported several times. | 2 warnings | WS5 |
| Wildcard, for situations not described above. | 1 warning | WSX |

#### Rules & Agreements

- Meetings are mandatory for every member, unless stated otherwise.
- Official documentation about tasks is leading. Word to word agreements must be re-documented. This is to prevent miscommunication, and an outdated division of tasks.
- Communication goes via the WhatsApp group or Discord server.
- Notify the other members when you start on a task that isn't officially documented or is not assigned to you.
- You are responsible for your own task. Helping others with their tasks is optional and will not make them your responsibility.
- If you are done with your assigned task, inquire with the other members if you can help.
- You create a unique branch for your user story. This makes merge conflict handling a lot easier and faster.
- Decision-making is democratic.
- If you think you won't make a deadline, notify the members timely.
- The other team members will always have the right to deny a reason for breaking a misconduct rule.

#### Coding Conventions

To make sure all code adheres to modern and professional standards, we have several code conventions in place. Following these conventions is mandatory and backed by warnings.

- Write JSDoc for JavaScript functions. Make sure to define all parameters, return types and other decorators (throws, async, deprecated).
- Use TypeScript types where possible. Make sure you also use this typing system, and don’t cast everything to ‘as any’.
- Make sure your code editor uses the defined linter. The pipeline will reject unlinted code.
- Use sufficient comments throughout your code.
- Make sure your commit follows the convention as per the workshop:
  - Feat: add a dark mode switcher
- Use camelCase naming for JavaScript variables and kebab-case for CSS classes.
- Avoid the use of custom CSS and make sure to exhaust Tailwind’s features/classes.
- All code and documentation are in English.
- The rules above are custom, but always follow the official conventions.

#### Global Definition of Done

Before a user story is considered complete, it must follow the following rules:

- All code is peer reviewed before delivery.
- All code meets the stated coding conventions above.
- Test coverage is at least 80%. This is calculated by SonarQube.
- Before shipping, all unit tests and the pipeline should have passed.
- The related branch is merged and closed.
- All UI is responsive up to 320px (small mobile).

#### Roles

A division of tasks will be made for every member, but we also have some roles that can be seen as main responsibilities. Out of the team, these assigned members have the most amount of experience and/or knowledge about this discipline. This does not mean that unassigned person X does not work on the discipline Y.

| Role Name | Description/Tasks | Assigned Member |
|-|-|-|
| DevOps Engineer | Deployment, GitLab CI/CD | Stefan Kruik |
| UI/UX Designer | Supplying Figma designs | Donovan Tjokrodimedjo |
| Information Architect | Scrum master, technical documentation | Stefan Kruik |
| Database Engineer | EERD’s, database design | Stefan Kruik |
| Technical Lead | Architecture, maintaining standards, code reviews | Donovan Tjokrodimedjo |
| Backend Engineer | Routing, endpoints, auth solutions | Merlijn Bijenveld |
| Frontend Developer | Web Components | Max Pijnacker |

#### Signatures

The following members hereby declare that they have read the agreement and agree with all specified terms and conditions. They are aware that misconduct has negative consequences and strive to make the collaboration process as smooth and pleasant as possible.
