                About The Rabbit Network
            </h1>

            <p>
                <strong>The Rabbit Network</strong>, often abbreviated to just
                ‘Rabbit’, is a modern and community-focused social media and
                entertainment platform. It builds upon proven community-driven
                concepts like discussions, voting, and interactions.
            </p>

            <p>
                Users, known as <strong>Hoppers</strong>, participate in
                conversations and contribute under posts. The official
                community, <strong>Burrow</strong>, provides structure, but
                Rabbit focuses on <strong>user-generated content</strong> first.
                Functionally, it's comparable to platforms like Reddit and X.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some Hoppers become <strong>Keepers</strong> who moderate
                content within Burrows. Rabbit ensures that moderation scales
                with the community, with tools for Keepers and a staff-only
                admin page.
            </p>

                Product Vision
            </h1>

            <p>
                With a unique twist in terminology and an intuitive design,
                Rabbit aims to be an engaging and
                <strong>privacy-first alternative</strong> to current platforms.
                No ads. No data collection. Instead, revenue comes from cosmetic
                purchases using <strong>Carrots</strong>, the platform's
                currency.
            </p>

            <p>
                Rabbit stands with the modern movement of privacy-conscious
                apps. It promotes healthy discussion and expression through a
                familiar yet distinct platform.

                Rabbit is built using modern tech like <strong>Nuxt</strong> and
                <strong>Docker</strong> to provide scalability and
                developer-friendly experiences.

                About the Team
            </h1>

            <p>
                This project is developed by a team of students from the HBO-ICT
                Software Engineering program at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam
                (HvA). The Rabbit Network is part of a larger academic
                initiative where we explore the intersection of social
                technology, privacy, and community-focused development. This
                project is not only a technical challenge but also a
                representation of our vision for better online spaces.
