# TSE - Testing - Palindrome Assignment

I built the Palindrome assignment using Test Driven Development (TDD).

## Results & Findings

- One key effect that stood out when using the TDD approach is that when you start developing after completing the tests you have a clear direction.
- I often (internship, other projects) have a tendency to be really creative and might develop out of the bounds of the ticket.
- When the tests are complete you develop against the tests and do not add any new features because that would be outside scope and test coverage.
- When I made the test pass the code was not complete yet. For instance, there was a lot of code in the static main method that was later extracted.
  - Coverage for this new piece of code was missing. The tests were altered to support this new method.
  - Probably an error on my end, but I find it hard to 'predict' how the code is going to look like. During development you will come across beter/other ways.

## Comparison

After having a chat with my peer that did DDT we have come up with the following differences:

- Initially my peer was missing coverage for edge cases, which I already did cover while writing the tests first.
- My test cases where slightly larger and more varied. I also tested persistence.
- I finished my tests and their implementations first.
